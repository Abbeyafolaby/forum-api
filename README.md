cd forum-api

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env

## Auth Endpoints

- `POST /auth/signup` â€” Register a new user
  - Body:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "John Bay",
    "email": "johnbay@mail.com",
    "password": "johnspassword",
    "role": "user" // optional, accepts "admin" or "user"; defaults to "user"
  }
  ```

- `POST /auth/login` â€” Login and receive a JWT
  - Body:
  ```json
  {
    "email": "johnbay@mail.com",
    "password": "johnspassword"
  }
  ```

Include the token as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to access protected routes.

## Threads Endpoints

- `POST /threads` â€” Create a new thread (auth required)
  - Headers: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
  - Body:
  ```json
  {
    "title": "How to learn Node.js?",
    "body": "Share your best resources and tips."
  }
  ```

- `GET /threads` â€” List all threads (public)

- `DELETE /threads/:id` â€” Delete a thread (admin only)
  - Headers: `Authorization: Bearer <admin token>`
  - Notes: Requires the requesting user to have `isAdmin: true` or `role: 'admin'`. Deleting a thread also removes all its comments.

## Comments Endpoints

- `POST /threads/:id/comments` â€” Add a top-level comment to a thread (auth)
  - Headers: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
  - Body:
  ```json
  { "content": "This is a comment" }

- `POST /comments/:id/reply` â€” Reply to an existing comment (auth)
  - Headers: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
  - Body:
  ```json
  { "content": "This is a reply" }

Notes:
- Both comment endpoints require a non-empty `content` string.
- Replies inherit the thread from the parent comment.

## Voting Endpoints

- `POST /threads/:id/vote` â†’ Vote on a thread (auth)
  - Headers: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
  - Body:
  ```json
  { "value": 1 }
  ```
  - Notes: Use `1` for upvote, `-1` for downvote. Sending the same vote twice returns 400. Sending the opposite value flips your vote.

- `POST /comments/:id/vote` â†’ Vote on a comment (auth)
  - Headers: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
  - Body:
  ```json
  { "value": -1 }
  ```
  - Notes: Use `1` for upvote, `-1` for downvote. One vote per user per comment; duplicate same-value vote returns 400; opposite value flips your vote.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js â€” Runtime environment
- Express.js â€” Web framework
